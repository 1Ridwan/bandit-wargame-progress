### Goal:
Find the human readable file

### Commands Used

## I struggled with this one, but I learnt what human readable files mean now
## Also learnt how to use '-exec file {} \;' which seems like it will be really useful in the future!


# Level 5 -> Level 6

### Goal:
Find the file that is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, and not executable

### Commands Used
```bash
ls
cd inhere
ls
ind . -size 1033c
cat ./maybehere07/.file2

## Feel like i took the easy route as i only checked for files that were 1033 bytes in size...
